===============

Ruby wrapper around the WorldCat Metadata API

Dependencies:
* Requires the OCLC Auth gem.  Get from: https://github.com/OCLC-Developer-Network/oclc-auth-ruby before building.

Test files are found in the tests directories.  Demonstrates all the functions.

At this point, the gem is light on the exception handling.  The current todo:
1) Add better exception handling
2) Include helper functions to simplify data processing and reading (so you don't have to just deal with MARCXML)
